The purpose of this document is to summarise my findings in developing the polygenic model of RSS. I will begin with a  brief introduction of GWAS sumamry statistics and their uses. I'll then discuss the RSS
model, it's application 

* Outline
** Introduction
*** Background
**** Heritability estimation
**** Models of genetic architecture
