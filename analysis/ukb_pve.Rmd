## Introduction

below are pve estimates from 2 uk biobank traits (`birthweight-self` and `birthweight-child`) for which I could easily obtain sample size info.  For refernce, LD score regression gives $h^2$ estimates of these traits as being `0.124` and `0.112` respectively.

```{r,echo=F}
suppressMessages(library(tidyverse))
est_f <- dir("~/Dropbox/PolygenicRSS/output/pve/ukbb",full.names = T)
map_df(est_f,~suppressMessages(read_delim(.x,delim="\t"))) %>%
  select(trait_id,pve) %>%
  distinct()
```
